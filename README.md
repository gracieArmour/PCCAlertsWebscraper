### Arduino Code
[MasterProgram.py](PythonCode/FinalCode/MasterProgram.py)

```python
# import the necessary libraries
import pyfirmata
from time import sleep

# import the user-defined function files
import usr_functions

# tell the program what website to scrape from
url_to_check = 'https://jackiearmour.github.io/PCCAlertsWebscraper/' #'https://alert.pcc.edu/' 'https://jackiearmour.github.io/PCCAlertsWebscraper/'

# store the name of the USB port the Arduino is connected to
portName = '/dev/cu.usbserial-DN02SJR4'

# create the board object in Python
board = pyfirmata.Arduino(portName)

# setup the LEDs by storing their locations. d for digital, a for analogue, pin number, o for ouput, i for input, p for pwm
campusLED = [board.get_pin('d:10:o'),board.get_pin('d:11:o'),board.get_pin('d:12:o')]
alertLED = [board.get_pin('d:6:o'),board.get_pin('d:7:o'),board.get_pin('d:8:o')]
weatherLED = [board.get_pin('d:2:o'),board.get_pin('d:3:o'),board.get_pin('d:4:o')]


try:
    while True:
        # scrape the webpage
        page_status, status_text = usr_functions.scrape(url_to_check)
        
        # makes sure the webpage was reached before attempting to proccess the alert text
        if page_status=="Page Accessed!":
            campus_status, alert_status, weather_status = usr_functions.status_check(status_text) # processes the alert text
        else: # if page was not reached, set all LEDs to white
            print("No status to process")
            campus_status = 'white'
            alert_status = 'white'
            weather_status = 'white'
        
        # set the LEDs to the determined colors
        usr_functions.set_led(campusLED,campus_status)
        usr_functions.set_led(alertLED,alert_status)
        usr_functions.set_led(weatherLED,weather_status)

        # pause here for 30 seconds before checking again
        sleep(30)
        
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print(usr_functions.led_list)
    for LED in usr_functions.led_list:
        usr_functions.set_led(LED)
    print('Program stopped by user')
    raise

```

## Results:
The code results in three files with massive functions feeding into one compact file. The arduino code enables the LEDs to light up according to the alert assigned to a color.

![Results](READMEImages/resultsimage.jpg)

## Future Work:

What could another group of students do to build on this project? Any resources this group could use to build this future work?

A future group of students could add more LEDs/colors to indicate a wider range of alerts. This would require a larger or multiple redboards because more pins are needed to connect the hardware.
