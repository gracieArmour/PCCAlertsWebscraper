Arduino Predicts Impending Disaster

Problem Statement:

Our group was tasked with web scraping the PCC Alert Page to find alerts and present the alert in the form of an LEDâ€™s color change. https://alert.pcc.edu/

Arduino Code
MasterProgram.py
\# import the necessary libraries




import pyfirmata


from time import sleep







\# import the user-defined function files


import rgb_color


from webscraper import scrape


from statuschecker import status_check







\# tell the program what website to scrape from


url_to_check = 'https://alert.pcc.edu/' #'https://jackiearmour.github.io/PCCAlertsWebscraper/'







\# store the name of the USB port the Arduino is connected to


portName = '/dev/cu.usbserial-DN02SJR4'







\# create the board object in Python


board = pyfirmata.Arduino(portName)







\# setup the LEDs by storing their locations. d for digital, a for analogue, pin number, o for ouput, i for input, p for pwm


campusLED = [board.get_pin('d:10:o'),board.get_pin('d:11:o'),board.get_pin('d:12:o')]


alertLED = [board.get_pin('d:6:o'),board.get_pin('d:7:o'),board.get_pin('d:8:o')]


weatherLED = [board.get_pin('d:2:o'),board.get_pin('d:3:o'),board.get_pin('d:4:o')]












try:


   while True:


       # scrape the webpage


       page_status, status_text = scrape(url_to_check)


      


       if page_status=="Page Accessed!":


           campus_status, alert_status, weather_status = status_check(status_text)


       else:


           print("No status to process")


           campus_status = 'white'


           alert_status = 'white'


           weather_status = 'white'


      


       # set the LEDs to the determined colors


       rgb_color.set_led(campusLED,campus_status)


       rgb_color.set_led(alertLED,alert_status)


       rgb_color.set_led(weatherLED,weather_status)







       # pause here for 30 seconds before checking again


       sleep(30)


      


except KeyboardInterrupt:


   print(rgb_color.led_list)


   for LED in rgb_color.led_list:


       rgb_color.set_led(LED)


   print('Program stopped by user')


   raise
Results:
The code results in three files with massive functions feeding into one compact file. The arduino code enables the LEDs to light up according to the alert assigned to a color.


Future Work:

What could another group of students do to build on this project? Any resources this group could use to build this future work?

A future group of students could add more LEDs/colors to indicate a wider range of alerts. This would require a larger or multiple redboards because more pins are needed to connect the hardware.
